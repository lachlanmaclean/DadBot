# DadBot
A simple reddit bot that goes through comments on a particular subreddit and submits a dad joke as reply.


For this application to work, a config.py must be created with the format

username = "REDDIT USERNAME"
password = "REDDIT PASSWORD"
client_id = "CLIENT ID"
client_secret = "SECRET KEY"

The client_id and secret is created on Reddits app development panel
